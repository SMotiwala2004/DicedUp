# DicedUp
Text-Based RPG game

This Project uses the following technologies
- Java, File Input / Output, Object-Oriented Programming

- The game follows a narrative of a player who can explore, fight, and level up. The twist implemented into this game is that in the combat sequences, there's a dice that can change the outcome of the fight. 
- The exploring in this game isn't visual as it's a text-based game created to work on personal experience of user input, Game Logic, Code organization, and File handling.
- The game's code organization does allow expansion of the game in the future, through classes and methods that were created for specific uses. 
- The game also features capabilities of creating multiple saves locally, which allows save files to be transferred between devices through the cloud such as Google Drive, USB, etc.
